- IntelliJ if you would like to extend the features

## Build & Run
The project utilises Gradle Wrapper.
To build the project, browse to the project root directory and simply execute:
```
./gradlew build
```
To run the application, execute:
```
./gradlew bootRun
```
This will initialise SpringBoot on port 8080 where the API can be accessed via:

# Technical Notes
Below are some details on technical aspects of the project and few learnings.

## Assumptions & Design considerations
1. Default port will be -8080, which can be modified
2. Only minimal validations are provided.
3. Comes with few pre-loaded entries, which can be extended by providing an add API
4. 2 seperate controllers to keep it extendable to provide more operations
5. Discount information is stored in DB to provide extendable options for future.
6. Keeping in mind the possible extentions and addition of feature Factory Pattern is used to make it easily extendable.
7. Configurable Family size through application yaml properties.

## Scope for Enhancements
1. Extensive test cases to cover more scenarios can be added. Currently around 26 Test cases are added to cover some basic scenaios and end to end testing.
2. Validations can be enhanced to include more on the inputs. Basic validations are provided for now.
3. User Interface can be provided.
4. Various levels of testing can be included
5. More APIs to add and update directory can be included
6. Replace H2 Db, with proper db instance
7. Containerize for better deployment
8. Authontication and Security Checks can be added on top of the APIs to make it more secure



### Testing
Unit tests
TODO: Can be improved to include component,blackbox and controller tests etc.
TODO: Cover more validations and validation testing
